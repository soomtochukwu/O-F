> Empowering smallholder farmers through decentralized cooperation, shared resources, and transparent first-mile logistics.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers in Nigeria (and across Africa) face a triple bottleneck that limits their productivity and profitability:

1. **Low Production Capacity**: Farmers rely on harmful chemical inputs or slow manual organic production due to lack of tools, capital, and secure land access
2. **Post-Harvest Losses**: Poor pest management, inadequate feed, and lack of veterinary knowledge lead to significant crop spoilage and livestock deaths
3. **Broken First-Mile Logistics**: High transport costs, unreliable delivery, and no cost-sharing mechanisms prevent farmers from accessing profitable markets

**The Impact**: Despite having the skills, farmers remain trapped in low-yield, low-income cycles while missing out on formal finance opportunities.

## üí° Solution

ObodoFarm is a **Farmer Cooperative-as-a-Service** platform that digitizes trust, aggregates supply, and unlocks working capital through:

- **On-chain governance** for transparent decision-making
- **Tokenized pre-sales** and provenance tracking
- **Offline-first access** via USSD and field agents
- **Shared logistics network** ("Uber for Farm Produce")

### Core Features

#### ü§ù Production Boost Layer

- **Resource Pooling**: Cooperative funds provide shared equipment, organic inputs, and seeds
- **Democratic Proposals**: On-chain voting system for funding requests
- **Knowledge Hub**: Best practices for organic farming and livestock management

#### üöõ First-Mile Logistics Network

- **Shared Transport**: GPS-tracked rides with cost-sharing among farmers
- **Route Optimization**: Match farmers with available drivers/vehicles
- **Payment Escrow**: Automated payment release upon delivery confirmation

#### üí∞ Financial Infrastructure

- **F-Credit Scoring**: Alternative credit assessment using farming data
- **Tokenized Futures**: Pre-sale harvest tokens for buyer guarantees
- **Transparent Lending**: Community-backed microcredit with on-chain tracking

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Blockchain Infrastructure

- **Primary Network**: ObodoFarm Avalanche Subnet
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts for governance, payments, and tokenization
- **Testnet**: Deployed on Avalanche Fuji for development and testing

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React (mobile-responsive)
- **Mobile Access**: USSD integration via Africa'sTalking
- **Messaging**: SMS integration for AI advisory and alerts
- **Storage**: IPFS for metadata and receipts

### Accessibility

- **USSD Support**: Works on feature phones (\*347# shortcode)
- **Local Languages**: Multi-language support starting with Nigerian languages
- **Offline-First**: Field agents enable participation in low-connectivity areas

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
Node.js >= 16.0.0
PostgreSQL >= 12
Avalanche CLI
Foundry (for smart contracts)
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obodofarm/platform
cd obodofarm-platform
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
cd contracts && forge install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your Avalanche subnet RPC, Africa'sTalking API keys, etc.
```

4. **Deploy smart contracts**

```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $OBODOFARM_SUBNET_RPC --broadcast
```

5. **Start the application**

```bash
npm run dev
```

### USSD Testing

Dial `*347*1#` on your mobile device to test the onboarding flow.

## üì± Demo Flow

### For Farmers

1. **Onboard** via USSD (`*347*1#`) or mobile app
2. **Create Profile** (name, farm size, crop/livestock type)
3. **Submit Proposals** for tools, inputs, or transport needs
4. **Vote** on community proposals using F-Credit weight
5. **Book Transport** and track deliveries
6. **Receive** AI-powered farming tips via SMS

### For Drivers/Logistics Partners

1. **Register** as transport provider
2. **Accept** transport requests from farmers
3. **Track** deliveries via GPS
4. **Receive** automatic payment upon completion

### For Buyers/Investors

1. **Browse** farmer profiles and upcoming harvests
2. **Purchase** tokenized harvest futures
3. **Track** provenance and delivery
4. **Invest** in cooperative lending pools

## üíº Business Model

### Revenue Streams

- **Marketplace Commission**: 2-5% of gross merchandise value (GMV)
- **Logistics Fees**: Transport facilitation and GPS tracking
- **Microloan Interest**: Spread on community-backed lending
- **Storage Fees**: Warehouse receipt and inventory management
- **Data & SaaS**: Subscription fees from agribusinesses for verified farm data
- **Carbon Credits**: Revenue from verified organic farming practices

### Unit Economics (Conservative Scenario)

- 100,000 farmers √ó $150 annual GMV = $15M total GMV
- 3% commission = $450K annual revenue
- Plus lending, logistics, and data revenue streams
